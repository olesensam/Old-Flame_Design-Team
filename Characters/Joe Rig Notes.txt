1.0 - Body mechanics pretty much done. Right foot has a joint flipping problem. Fingers need weight painted first, the rest needs a lot of fine tuning. Body corrective blendshapes, face rig, body controls and deformers next on the hit list.

1.1 - FK hands and feet switched to follow parents, right foot flipping fixed, backpack integrated, a fair bit of weight painting, back fixed.
